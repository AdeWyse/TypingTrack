# Typing Track

This project is a single page application (SPA) using Angular. The aim is to create an app that tracks
how many words the user can type in the specified window time. Then present the results on an animated graphic using te wpm (words per minute) unit.
With multiple runs of the same user on the same browser the data and graphics will become more precise.
